ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Simon, a software engineer and a technical writer.

I've built my first web-page at 16 in Macromedia Dreamweaver. It was the "Quantum physics in simple terms" site. I remember that I've used some random googled JavaScript scripts for dynamic menus and my site was starting through the VisualBasic desktop app with a drum'n'bass music ðŸ˜‚.

Since then I'd received a Master's Degree in CS and managed to work in various positions: from a carwash worker to a chef's assistant in the restaurant, from a laboratory worker to an solution architect in the software development company.

ðŸ“š I've always been a big fan of learning new technologies and discovering how things work.

I believe that documenting and sharing new knowledge helps to understand deeper the things you've researched. I try to share my new findings that aren't well highlighted on the web. I'll be happy knowing if someone would solve his problem by reading one of my posts.

ðŸ™Œ This blog is inspired by [Kalle Hallden's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ/channels), [Tania Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/)  and [Flavio Copes's](https://flaviocopes.com/) works.

## My setup

My current setup is pretty simple:

- MacBook Pro 16' 2021
- DELL UltraSharp U2719DC 27" monitor
- Ikea desk
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- Some random mouse
- VSCode

## Soundcloud

ðŸŽ· Music is also my big passion and a huge part of my life. It helps me to go through the long coding sessions. [Here is the place](https://soundcloud.com/steamysunnyspace) where I try to give some structure to my latest findings.
